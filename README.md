# City-Connect
-->This project is a smart community management platform designed to enhance civic engagement, ensure public safety, and streamline issue resolution through AI and real-time communication. It provides a unified interface for residents, municipal corporations (MC), service providers, and local authorities.

--> Key Modules
A. Module A (MC to Residents)
Receive official alerts, safety notifications, and public announcements from your local Municipal Corporation.

B. Module B (Residents to Residents)
Enables communication among residents to build stronger, safer, and more connected neighborhoods.

C. Module C (Residents to MC)
Effortlessly report civic issues, like potholes or water leaks, directly to the Municipal Corporation with images and location tagging.

D. Module D (Residents to Local Service Providers)
A streamlined ticketing system for managing complaints related to electricity, plumbing, and other essential services.

E. Module E (Issue Verification and Escalation)
A democratic layer where elected representatives verify citizen reports and escalate legitimate issues to the MC.

F. Module F (AI-Enabled Monitoring)
Uses sensors and cameras for real-time monitoring of noise and air pollution. AI algorithms help detect and identify violations and offenders.

--> User Profiles
Residents have virtual profiles with a scoring system based on their civic behavior (e.g., reports submitted, violations committed).

Service providers maintain profiles that include ratings and feedback from residents for transparency and accountability.

--> Technologies Used
i). Frontend: Pyhton

ii). Backend: Node.js

iii). AI: TensorFlow / OpenCV for violation detection

iv). Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL

v). IoT Integration: Raspberry Pi / Arduino with environmental sensors
